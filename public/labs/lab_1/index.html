<h1>Adam Iravani's Lab 1</h1>

<p>First, the basics.</p>

<h2>The basics</h2>

<p>Headings set your default page size</p>

<img src="images/mochi.svg"width=75 alt="A dancing mochi ball"/>
<img src="images/mochi.jpg"width=150 alt="A mochi ball"/>
<img src="images/mochi.png"width=150 alt="A mochi ball with BÃ©zier handles"/>
<p>Add your four mochi images from your tutorial here.</p>
<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>Let's make an unordered list.</p>
<ul>
    <li>HTML/CSS underpins most of our user interfaces now</li>
    <li>CSS tries something so hard no other computer language even bothers</li>
    <li>Javascript got popular from having a runtime in every browser in the world</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, one in order.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Album 1</li>
    <li>Album 2</li>
    <li>Album 3</li>
    <li>Album 4</li>
    <li>Check it out, numbers by default.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Inline Elements</h2>
<p>Sometiems you want to <em>draw attention</em> to something in a line of text.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize</strong> something in the text.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sometimes you want to do both.</strong></em></p>
<h2>Empty Elements</h2>
<p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.</br>
Neither can image tags, or hard lines.</br>
</br>
Add a hard line break under here.</p>

<p>This page probably doesn't look that great - we'll learn how to hook it to CSS next week.</p>

Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.

Sometimes you want to do both.

Empty Elements
